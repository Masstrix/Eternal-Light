# Eternal Light is a plugin based from the Not Enough Item's mod light level overlays.
# Red meaning hostile mobs can spawn at any time; yellow only during night and green
# meaning that light levels are to high for hostile mobs to spawn.
# 
# PERMISSIONS
#   eternallight.admin - Allows players to use /el
#   eternallight.use   - Allows players to use /ll
#   eternallight.mode  - Allows players to use /ll mode and /ll help. If they do not have this 
#                        permission they will only be able to use the default display mode.
# 
# COMMANDS
#   /el or /eternallight - (eternallight.admin) Displays admin command.
#   /lightlevels or /ll  - (eternallight.use) Enables the light overlay.
#   /lightlevels mode    - (eternallight.use) Toggles between active modes.
# 
# MODES
#   SPAWNABLE  - Red and yellow areas shown.
#   ALL        - Red, yellow and green areas shown.
#   LIGHTLEVEL - All areas show like ALL mode but smoothed.
# 
# EXPLANATIONS
#   radius           - Sets the radius players can see light levels in. It's advised to keep this
#                      lower as it adds exponentially more load on the server the larger it is.
#   update-rate      - Sets how long to wait between each display render of the particles in ticks (20 ticks a second). 
#                      Increasing this will reduce load on the server as people use it.
#   default-mode     - Default mode used for when players first toggle on the display.
#   messages.enabled - If false players will not see activate, deactivate and change-mode messages.
